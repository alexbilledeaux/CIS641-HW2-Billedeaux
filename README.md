- My personal interests are primarily reading and gaming. I generally read science fiction, nonfiction, and horror novels. I tend to play RPGs and strategy games.
- Technically, I am interested in moving to a position that does more feature-focused development. Most of my experience up to this point has been in a design and front-end capacity.
- In regard to research, I am currently interested in search-based algorithms. I did some interesting research on applying genetic algorithms to software testing with Dr. DeVries last year.

## Technical Background
While pursuing my undergraduate degree in English, I began creating simple hobby projects like console program video games and mods for games in the Elder Scrolls series. After school ended, I got a junior front-end developer role and learned to program HTML, CSS with precompilers, and some Angular on the job. After relocating to the other side of the state, I needed to search for a new job so I got a role as an email campaign developer. This primarily comprised of very restrictive raw HTML and CSS. Eventually I moved up to a more senior role and was able to work on internal tool software.
